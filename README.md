What is UmaWings: Idea 

It started last year, when me and my friend started talking about how facebook is getting boring day by day, and with all these adds + weirdo changes might make some of us quit the damn blue beast. yes i got trapped into this and started designing some data diagrams for a new self-hosted-content-management-system, just like twitter or Facebook or why not both?
